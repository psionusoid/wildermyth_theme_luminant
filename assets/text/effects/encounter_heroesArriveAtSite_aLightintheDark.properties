~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=Inspired by a local legend, <bookish> convinces <company> to explore a bit deeper in the caverns below <site> than strictly necessary to face the <foes.plural>.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/60:What a fortuitous research opportunity!/<bookish.loner/80:[face:default]You didn't need to come along, you know./I can't believe we're finally going to see the Shrine of Light!>>
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hero3=<bookish.loner/80:And have us need to find you later?/>
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_snark=<bookish.bookish/60:/Didn't you learn about it [i]yesterday[]? >How do you know the shrine even exists?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/60:<npc4.fullName> mentioned it in book name. <npc4.mf:He's/She's/They're> pretty reliable about this sort of information./[face:joy]I don't. But I couldn't resist finding out!>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_snark=But none of the locals have ever seen it?
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_action=...crumble
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero3=These caves were pretty dangerous even before the <foes.plural> moved in. <hero3.leader/coward/60:We should keep moving./I don't want to stay here longer than we have to./Let's keep moving.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_narration=As the hours pass, a thought grows stronger and stronger in <snark>'s mind.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_snark=<snark.snark/goofball/60:[face:joke]So, if there's one thing caves are known for, it's the abundance of lighting. Why's the shrine here?/[face:joke]So, if there's one thing caves are known for, it's the abundance of lighting. Why's the shrine here?/Why's a shrine dedicated to light so deep underground, anyway?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/60:The builders believed that by showing a brilliant light could exist in such a dark place, even fleetingly, it meant there way always reason for hope./It means that light is more special, I suppose.>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_narration=Even in the torchlight, they are nearly upon it before they notice.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hero3=Is that...?
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_bookish=It's amazing!

~01~prompt~panel_013~1_bookish=<bookish.bookish/60:[face:talking]The sun would have to be in a [i]very[] specific position. It'd only be lit for less than a minute once per year. Unfortunately, there's no record of [i]what[] position that is, but I wouldn't expect it to happen [i]now[]./<bookish.hook_Lucky:It's dark [i]now[]. />The locals said it's only lit once a year, but no one knows when!>
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_hero3=How long are you planning on staying? <hero3.leader/coward/60:[face:grim]The <foes.plural> are still our priority./We're not the only ones down here./[face:grim]The <foes.plural>...>
~01~prompt~panel_014~2_bookish=<bookish.bookish/60:It shouldn't be too long. I just want to take some notes./<bookish.hook_Lucky:Oh, it shouldn't be too long!/I just want to look around a bit.>>
